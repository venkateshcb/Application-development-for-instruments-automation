# Application development for instruments automation
1. Developed the user interface for automation of instruments using Python, Verilog, and FPGA.
2. Worked with instruments including SMW 200A Vector Signal Generator, FSW Signal and Spectrum Analyzer, and SMA100B Signal Generator.
3. Implemented automation to send data via UART, set parameters, and record data. 
4. Contributed to the development of a comprehensive automation system for these instruments.
