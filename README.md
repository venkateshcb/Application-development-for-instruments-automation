# Application development for instruments automation
1. Automated Testing of Xband-Synthesiser with VISA and Python and reduced the testing time by 90%.
2. Worked with instruments such as Vector Signal Generator, Signal and Spectrum Analyzer.
3. Developed a comprehensive automation system with GUI for these instruments using SCPI commands and serial communication with FPGA.
4. Implemented automation to send data via UART, set parameters, and record data.
